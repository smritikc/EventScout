# 🎉 EventScout(without Ticketing system)/EventPass(After integrating Ticketing System)

EventScout is a modern **Event Management and Ticketing Platform** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  

It allows users to **discover events, register, make payments, and receive secure digital tickets (QR-based)**.  
It works like a simplified version of platforms such as **Eventbrite or Meetup**.

---

# 🚀 What EventScout Does

EventScout solves the problem of fragmented event discovery and manual registration by providing a centralized system where:

## 👤 For Users:
- Browse all available events
- Search and view event details
- Register for events
- Make payments (if event is paid)
- Receive a **unique digital ticket (QR code)**
- View registered events in dashboard

## 🧑‍💼 For Organizers/Admin:
- Create and manage events
- Set event details (date, time, location, price)
- Track registered users
- Validate tickets at entry
- Prevent fake or duplicate entries

---

# 🎟️ Ticket System (Core Feature)

The ticket system ensures every valid user gets a **secure, unique digital ticket**.

## 🧭 How Ticket System Works

### 1️⃣ Event Registration
User clicks **Register Event**

Backend checks:
- Is user logged in?
- Is user already registered?

---

### 2️⃣ Payment (if required)
If event is paid:

- User completes payment via gateway (Stripe / Khalti / Esewa)
- Backend verifies payment (NOT frontend)

---

### 3️⃣ Ticket Generation
After successful registration/payment:

System generates a ticket:

```json id="ticket_example"
{
  "ticketId": "EVT-8X92K-2026",
  "userId": "USER123",
  "eventId": "EVENT456",
  "qrCode": "encrypted_secure_token",
  "status": "valid"
}

4️⃣ Ticket Delivery

User receives ticket via:

Dashboard download
Email
QR code display
5️⃣ Event Entry (Validation)

At event gate:

Organizer scans QR code
Backend verifies ticket
Marks ticket as USED
🔐 Security System (VERY IMPORTANT)

EventScout ensures only valid users get tickets.

🚫 1. Authentication Required

Only logged-in users can:

Register for events
Access tickets

Uses:

JWT Authentication
🔒 2. Backend Validation (Never trust frontend)

Backend verifies:

User identity
Event registration
Payment status
🎟️ 3. Unique Secure Tickets

Each ticket:

Has unique ID
Uses encrypted QR code (not plain data)
Cannot be guessed or duplicated
🧾 4. Payment Verification

Payments are verified using backend integration:

Stripe / Khalti / Esewa APIs
Webhook confirmation (secure verification)

❌ Frontend success is NOT trusted

🛑 5. Prevent Duplicate Tickets

System ensures:

One user = one ticket per event
🚷 6. Ticket Usage Control

At entry:

If ticket already used → reject entry
If invalid → reject entry
If valid → mark as used
